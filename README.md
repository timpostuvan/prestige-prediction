### NML Project

Node level features
* Rank
* Field
* Presitge
* Production Rank? 

Staff make-up:
* Attrition
* Up Hires / Down Hires

Edge features
* University (from -> to)



Initial analyses:
* Cleaning the graph. 
* Add additional features. Degree distribution, clustering coefficents on domains. 
    * Number of nodes, number of edges, clustering coefficent, average degree, graph density, average distance, percentage male vs. female, gini coefficent, % international.
* Most international universities.
* Remove non-US universities. 
* How does diversity affect presitge? 
* 8 domains + academia. 
* Clustering coefficents / 


Sample tasks:
* Predict university rank given hiring decisions
* Predict faculty gender / race based on geography / taxonomy

Exploration:
* Can geography affect hiring decisions. Are there more conservative regions than others?
* Consider the US institutions. Add a field for hires outside the United States. How much they hire by specific country.
